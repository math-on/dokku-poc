# Heroku-like deploy on kubernetes

This is supposed to be a POC of joining the best of all worlds: the Heroku-like deploy we all love with the price of running on a VM with kubernetes orchestration.

Tools that make this possible:
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- [Deis Workflow](https://github.com/deis/workflow)
